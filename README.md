# Your-First-Contribution

Hey friend! 👋 

Welcome to this repository which marks your start in the Open Source World!! 🌐👯‍♀️

In the next 10 min, you will contribute to your first Open Source projects - how crazyyy is that. 🚀

Now when contributing, we want to:

**1. fork -> 2. clone -> 3. edit -> 4. push -> 5. pull**

### Now, what does that mean in normal language? 🙈

1. Fork: Make a **copy of the project** on your GitHub account 
2. Clone: **Download the project** from GitHub on your computer
3. Edit: That's self-explanatory - here you will **help us write the Greatest Story the World has Ever heard!! 🔥** 
4. Push: **Update and send the changes** to your online GitHub repository
5. Pull: **Send your contribution to the original GitHub repository**

That may sound a bit intimidating, but don't worry I got you! 👯‍♀️

Also if you are wondering, YES, this is how all the devs in the world contribute to software projects online! 

So in this project, you will have a great understanding of the mechanics behind GitHub so that you are ready for your future contributions! 

You reeeeeady?? Let's do it - we got this ☕️🫶

Requirement: If not already done, download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## 1. Fork the project

First, click on `⭐️ star` in the right corner (to show some love 🫶💁‍♀️) and then click on the `fork` button.

Fork means you will create a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account. 💪

Now that you have the copy on your own account, let's download the entire project on your local computer!

## 2. Clone the repository

1️⃣ You should now have landed on your forked repo page, here you will see a `<>` button marked in green, click on it.

2️⃣ Click on the button looking like a `double square` (highlighted in red below) to copy the URL.

<img width="411" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-29 at 11 47 49" src="https://github.com/fernandezbaptiste/Your-First-Contribution/assets/83458751/4a0f5bbc-854a-4df0-845d-fa8266414264">

3️⃣ Open your terminal.

4️⃣ Use your terminal to move to a folder where you want to put the cloned project (using more technical language, this is called moving to a directory of your choice). 📁 

5️⃣ Type `git clone` and then paste the URL copied earlier.

You normally should have written 
`git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`

6️⃣ Press Enter.

## 3. Open the File and Make changes

The entire project is now on your computer! 

1️⃣ On your terminal, make sure that you are in the project (or directory 😉) by running: `cd Your-First-Contribution`.

2️⃣ Open the `OurStory.txt` file in a text editor or on your favourite IDE (aka VS Code, Atom, PyCharm, Sublime etc). 

Here you will see the project which you will contribute to. 💪

The project is ***a story told by many developers around the planet - one contribution at a time! 🎙️***

This means each sentence you are reading was written in the past by different coders out there. 👩‍💻

And now it's your turn to add the next sentence! 👩‍🎨

3️⃣ Think of something that would make sense in the storyline and write one or two sentences.

4️⃣ When done, save the file!

## 4. Upload your changes to your online GitHub repo

OK, we got some changes done, now we need to upload them to our GitHub account.

In summary here we want to:
- ➕ add all the changes onto git
- 💬 add a commit message (which helps tell other devs what you have changed) and 
- 💾 push the changes to your online GitHub repository. 

1️⃣ So in your terminal, run the following command: `git add .`

2️⃣ After that, run: `git commit -m "description of what you changed/added"`

3️⃣ Finally, run: `git push`

At this point, if this is your first time, GitHub will ask you to authenticate yourself with your username and password. 🔐

4️⃣ Write out your GitHub username first and press Enter. 

5️⃣ For your password, ever since Aug 2021, it is a personal token you need to write (and not your actual password!). Don't worry though, let's get your token together by following the below: ☺

- On your GitHub account, hover to the top right of the page and click on your profile image

- Now click on `profile setting` 

- Find and Click on `developer setting`

- Click on `Personal Access Tokens (Token Classic)`

- Click on `Generate new token (classic)`

- Give a name e.g "authentification token"

At this point, you should be here ⬇️:

6️⃣ Select the scopes you want (for ease you can select all of them).

7️⃣ Click on `Generate token`

8️⃣ Your token will be displayed and you will be able to paste it into your terminal after which your push should have been successful! 🎉


## 5. Time to contribute! Send your changes from your online repo to the original repo 

We are so close to the end now! 🤙

All we need to do is now send over our changes to the original repository to make our contribution. 

In "GitHub language", this is called **"pulling a request"** because you essentially "pull" your changes into the original repository that you forked. 

1️⃣ Go now to your GitHub repo page online.

2️⃣ Click on the `Contribute` button.

3️⃣ Click on `Open pull request`

![Screenshot 2023-06-09 at 12 18 06](https://github.com/fernandezbaptiste/Your-First-Contribution/assets/83458751/06737cdf-5e77-456b-9dd8-5a6fe12b0769)
*This is an example of pulling a request for another repo so don't worry about the name being different*

--

4️⃣ You will then title your pull request with your *"Name Surname - adding my part of the story"* and you can leave the comment section blank.

5️⃣ Click `Create pull request` and that's it you have made your first contribution!! 🚀👯‍♀️

Congraaaaaaaats! ⭐️

You may be thinking, I thought I would be taken to the repository straight away but I'm left with the status of the pull request?


**YES**, this is because now we will review the best sentences added and accept the ones we think are cool and relevant to the story! 

All in all, contributions happen in this way where the maintainer(s) of the original repository (aka the people that are in charge of the repo) check your contributions and either end up accepting them or giving you feedback on what changes they need from you. 

So sit back and relax as you have just done everything you needed!

We know it is always super tough the first time and it's really cool you got to this point - so proud of you! 👯‍♀️💚
