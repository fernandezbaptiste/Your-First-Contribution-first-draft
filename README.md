# Your-First-Contribution

Hey you! Welcome to this repository which marks your start in the Open Source World!! 🌐👯‍♀️

In the next 10 min, you will contribute to your first Open Source projects - how crazyyy is that 🚀

To fully understand what the below steps do, we essentially want to:

**1. fork -> 2. clone -> 3. edit -> 4. push -> 5. pull**

What does that mean in normal language? 🙈

1. Fork: Make a **copy of the project** on your Github account 
2. Clone: **Download the project** from Github on your computer
3. Edit: That's self-explanatory - here you will **help us write the Greatest Story the World has Ever heard!! 🔥** 
4. Push: **Update and send the changes** to your online Github repository
5. Pull: **Send your contribution to the original Github repository**

That may sound a bit intimidating, but don't worry I got you! 👯‍♀️

Also if you are wondering, YES, this is how all the devs in the world contribute to software projects online! 

So in this project you will have a great understanding of the mechanics behind Github so that you are ready for your future contributions! 

You reeeeeady?? Let's do it - we got this ☕️🫶

Requirement: If not already done, download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## 1. Fork the project

First, click on `⭐️ star` in the right corner (to show some love 🫶💁‍♀️) and then click on the `fork` button.

Fork means you will create a copy of this repository in your own Github account. 💪

2️Now that you have the copy on your own account, let's download the entire project on your local computer!

## 2. Clone the repository

1️⃣ You should now have landed on your forked repo page, here you will see a `<>` button marked in green, click on it.
2️⃣ Click on the button looking like a `double square` (highlighted in red below) to copy the URL.

3️⃣ Open your terminal 
4️⃣ Use your terminal to move to a folder where you want to put the cloned project (using more technical language, this is called moving to a directory of your choice). 📁 
5️⃣ Then type `git clone` and then paste the URL copied earlier

You normally should have written 
`git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`

6️⃣ Press Enter

## 3. Open the File and Make changes

The entire project is now on your computer! 

Open your terminal make sure that you are in the project by running:
`cd Your-First-Contribution`

Now open the `OurStory.txt` file in a text editor or on your favourite IDE (aka VS Code, Atom, PyCharm, Sublime etc). 

Here you will see the project which you will contribute to. 💪

The project is ***a story told by many developers around the planet - one contribution at a time! 🎙️***

This means each sentence you are reading was written in the past by different coders out there. 👩‍💻

And now it's your turn to add the next sentence! 👩‍🎨

Think of something that would make sense in the storyline and write one or two sentences.

When done, save the file!

## 4. Upload your changes to your online Github repo

OK, we got some changes done, now we need to upload them to our Github account.

In summary here we want to:
- ➕ add all the changes onto git
- 💬 add a commit message (which helps tell other devs what you have changed) and 
- 💾 push the changes to your online Github repository. 

So in your terminal, run the following command:
`git add .` 

After that run:
`git commit -m "description of what you changed/added"`

Finally, run:
`git push` 

At this point, if this is your first time, Github will ask you to authenticate yourself with your username and password. 🔐

Write out your Github username first. 
For your password, ever since Aug 2021, it is a personal token you need to write (and not your actual password!). 

Don't worry though, let's get your token together. ☺️

To get this token, head on Github to: 
`profile setting` -> `developer setting` -> `Personal Access Tokens (Token Classic)` -> `Generate new token (classic)` -> give a name e.g "authentification token" -> select the scopes you want (for ease you can select all of them) -> click on `Generate token`

Your token will be displayed and you will be able to paste it into your terminal after which your push should have been successful! 


## 5. Time to contribute! Send your changes from your online repo to the original repo 

We are so close to the end now! 🤙

All we need to do is now send over our changes to the original repository to make our contribution. 

In "Github language", this is called **"pulling a request"** because you essentially "pull" your changes into the original repository that you forked. 

Go now to your Github repo page online, click on the `Contribute` button and then `Open pull request` 

![Screenshot 2023-06-09 at 12 18 06](https://github.com/fernandezbaptiste/Your-First-Contribution/assets/83458751/06737cdf-5e77-456b-9dd8-5a6fe12b0769)
*This is an example of pulling a request for another repo so don't worry about the name being different*

--

You will then title your pull request with your *"Name Surname - adding my part of the story"* and you can leave the comment section blank.

Click `Create pull request` and that's it you have made your first contribution!! 🚀👯‍♀️


I know, crazy right? 


You may be thinking, I thought I would be taken to the repository straight away but I'm left with the status of the pull request.


YES, this is because now we will review the best sentences added and accept the ones we think are cool and relevant to the story! 

Well done on this friend! 

All in all, contributions happen in this way where the maintainer(s) of the original repository (aka the people that are in charge of the repo) check your contributions and either end up accepting them or giving you feedback on what changes they need from you. 


We know it is always super tough the first time and it's really cool you got to this point - so proud of you! 👯‍♀️💚
