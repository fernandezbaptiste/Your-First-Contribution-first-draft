# Your-First-Contribution

Hey you! Welcome to this repository which marks your start in the Open Source World!! 🌐👯‍♀️

In the next 10 min, you will contribute to your first Open Source projects - how crazyyy is that 🚀

To fully understand what the below steps do, we essentially want to :

1. fork -> 2. clone -> 3. edit -> 4. pull 

In what does that mean in normal language 🙈:

1. Make a copy of this project 
2. Open the project on your local computer
3. Edit a couple of things in a file ( this will be your contribution to the project 🔥 ) 
4. Send the updated project with your name to Github

That's what you will be doing, and believe it or not, but that will be your first contribution!
I know right? Sounds much less scary than you imagined right? 

This is will teach you the mechanics of Github so you are ready for your next contributions! 

You ready?? Let's do it - we got this ☕️🫶

Requirement: If not already done, download Git [here]([url](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)).

## 1. Fork the project

Start by click on `star ` (to show some love 🫶) and click on the `fork ` button.

Fork means will create a copy of this repository in your own Github account. 💪

Now that you have the copy on your account, let's bring the entire project on your local computer!

## 2. Clone the repository

After step 1, you will land on your forked repo page, here you will see a `<>` button marked in green, click on it and copy the URL.

Open your terminal, move to a directory of your choice (maybe more can be expanded here- or drop a link) and run the following git command:

`git clone "url you just copied" `

## 4. Open the File and Make changes

The entire project is now on your computer! 

Now, make sure from your terminal that you are now in the project by running:
`cd Your-First-Contribution`

Now open the OurStory.txt file in on your favourite IDE or even just a text editor. 

Here you will see the project which you will contribute to.
The project is a story being built by many developers around the planet, all one by one by adding the next latest sentence at the end of the file.

Now its your turn 🤩

Add up one or two sentences that you think would make sense in the storyline.

Save the file 

## 5. Send your changes to your personal Repo

In your terminal, type 
`git add . ` 

right after type
`git commit -m "your name" `

and finally
`git push ` 

Github will ask you to authenticate yourself with your username and password. 
For your password, ever since Agu 2021, it is no longer your actual password they need but actually a personal token. 

To get this token, head on Github to: 
`profile setting ` -> `developer setting ` -> `Personal Access Tokens (Token Classic) ` -> `Generate new token (classic) ` -> give a name e.g "authentification token" -> select the scopes you want (for ease you can select all of them) -> click on `Generate token `

Your token will be displayed and you will be able to paste it into your terminal after which your push should have been successful! 

Here, we have essentially "added" all the changes, added a commit message (which helps tell other devs what you have changed) and pushed the changes into your online Github repository. 

## 6. Convert your changes from your repo to the original repo 

Go now to your forked Github repo page online, click on the `Contribute ` button and then `Open pull request`

*This is an example of pulling a request for another repo so don't worry about the name being different*

You will then title your pull request with "Name Surname - adding my part of the story" and you can leave the comment section blank.

Click `Create pull request ` and that's it you have made your first contribution! 

We will review the best sentences added and accept the ones we think are cool and relevant to the story! 

Really well done on this, we know it is super tough to do it the first time and its really cool you got to this point - so proud of you! 👯‍♀️💚
